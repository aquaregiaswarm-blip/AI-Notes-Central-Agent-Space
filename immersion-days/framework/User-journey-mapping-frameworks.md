## 1. Key Frameworks

| Framework | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Double Diamond** | Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver (diverge/converge twice) | Structuring the entire UX process |
| **Service Blueprint** | Journey map + backstage processes + support systems | Complex service design |
| **Experience Map** | Broader than journey map — full ecosystem view | Multi-channel experiences |
| **Empathy Map** | Think/Feel/Say/Do quadrants per persona | Quick persona development |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)** | Focus on the "job" users hire your product for | Feature prioritization |

**Key Principles:**
- **Iteration**: Continuous improvement and refinement of ideas
- **User-Centered Approach**: Focus on understanding the customer and their needs
- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Engage teams early to balance desirability, feasibility, and viability

## 2. Modern Trends (2024-2026)

- **Real-time Journey Orchestration** — Not just mapping, but live adjustment based on behavior data
- **AI-Powered Insights** — Combining behavioral data + emotional cues + predictive analytics
- **Emotion-Driven Design** — Mapping the emotional curve is now central, not optional
- **Personalization at Scale** — Dynamic journeys that adapt per user segment
- **Immersive Tech** — AR/VR touchpoints becoming part of the journey

---

## 3. Journey Map Components

1. **Stages** — Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Onboarding → Usage → Advocacy
2. **Actions** — What the user does at each stage
3. **Touchpoints** — Where they interact with your product/service
4. **Thoughts** — What they're thinking
5. **Emotions** — How they feel (the emotional curve)
6. **Pain Points** — Friction at each stage
7. **Opportunities** — Where you can improve

---

## 4. Interactive Workshop Techniques

### Facilitation Methods

1. **Sticky Note Mapping** — Physical/digital collaborative mapping
2. **Walk the Wall** — Participants physically walk through journey stages
3. **Role Play** — Act out the journey from user perspective
4. **Emotional Curve Drawing** — Plot emotions on a timeline together
5. **"A Day in the Life"** — Narrative storytelling exercise

### Iterative Process

```
Round 1: Assumption Mapping (what we think we know)
    ↓
Round 2: Validation (interviews/data)
    ↓
Round 3: Current State Map (as-is)
    ↓
Round 4: Pain Point Prioritization
    ↓
Round 5: Future State Map (to-be)
    ↓
Round 6: Opportunity Backlog
    ↓
[Repeat as product evolves]
```

## 5. Emotional Mapping

### Process

1. Identify key moments in the journey
2. Ask: "What emotion did you feel here?"
3. Use emotional vocabulary cards (frustrated, delighted, anxious, confident)
4. Plot on a -5 to +5 emotional scale
5. Look for "moments of truth" (highest/lowest points)

### Emotional Vocabulary

| Positive | Neutral | Negative |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Delighted | Curious | Frustrated |
| Confident | Uncertain | Anxious |
| Relieved | Indifferent | Confused |
| Excited | Cautious | Overwhelmed |
| Satisfied | Patient | Disappointed |

# Interactive Facilitation Script

## AI-Facilitated User Journey Mapping Session

*A guided, iterative process for mapping user journeys through conversation.*

---

### Pre-Session Setup

**Facilitator announces:**
> "We're going to map the user journey for [PRODUCT/SERVICE]. This will take about 45-60 minutes. I'll guide you through each phase with questions. Everyone's input matters — there are no wrong answers."

**Materials needed:**
- Shared document or whiteboard (Miro, FigJam, or physical)
- Participant list with roles
- Timer for each phase

---

### Phase 1: Persona Definition (10 min)

**Facilitator asks:**

> "Let's start by defining who we're mapping for."

1. **"Who is your primary user? What's their job title or role?"**
   - Wait for response, confirm understanding

2. **"What are their top 3 goals when using [product/service]?"**
   - List each goal

3. **"What frustrates them most in their current workflow?"**
   - Capture pain points

4. **"In one sentence, how would this user describe themselves?"**
   - This becomes the persona quote

**Facilitator synthesizes:**
> "So our persona is [NAME], a [ROLE] who wants to [GOALS] but struggles with [FRUSTRATIONS]. Does that sound right?"

---

### Phase 2: Stage Identification (10 min)

**Facilitator asks:**

> "Now let's identify the stages of their journey. I'll suggest a starting framework, but tell me if your journey is different."

**Default stages:**
1. Awareness — How do they first hear about you?
2. Consideration — How do they evaluate you?
3. Decision — How do they decide to buy/sign up?
4. Onboarding — How do they get started?
5. Usage — How do they use the product day-to-day?
6. Advocacy — How do they become promoters?

**For each stage, ask:**
> "Does [STAGE] apply to your journey? If so, what triggers the move INTO this stage?"

**Facilitator confirms:**
> "Our journey has [X] stages: [LIST]. Everyone agree?"

---

### Phase 3: Touchpoint Mapping (15 min)

**For each stage, facilitator asks:**

> "At the [STAGE] stage, where does [PERSONA] interact with you?"

**Prompt options:**
- "Is it on your website? Which page?"
- "Do they talk to a person? Who?"
- "Is there an email, ad, or notification?"
- "What about app, phone, or in-person?"

**Capture format:**
```
Stage: [NAME]
Touchpoints:
  - [Touchpoint 1]
  - [Touchpoint 2]
Actions user takes:
  - [Action 1]
  - [Action 2]
```

---

### Phase 4: Emotional Pulse (10 min)

**Facilitator explains:**

> "Now the important part — how does the user FEEL at each stage? Rate each on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is frustrated/anxious and 10 is delighted/confident."

**For each stage, ask:**
> "At [STAGE], what's the emotional score? 1-10?"

**Follow-up:**
> "What word describes that feeling? (frustrated, anxious, hopeful, confident, delighted...)"

**Facilitator identifies peaks and valleys:**
> "I see the lowest point is [STAGE] at [SCORE]. The highest is [STAGE] at [SCORE]. These are your 'moments of truth.'"

---

### Phase 5: Pain Points Deep Dive (10 min)

**Focus on the lowest-scoring stages:**

> "Let's dig into [LOW STAGE]. You rated it [SCORE]."

1. **"What specifically causes friction here?"**
2. **"What do users complain about or ask support about?"**
3. **"If you could wave a magic wand, what would you fix?"**

**Repeat for top 2-3 pain points.**

---

### Phase 6: Opportunity Synthesis (5 min)

**Facilitator synthesizes:**

> "Based on what we mapped, here are the opportunities I see:"

**Format:**
```
OPPORTUNITY 1: [Name]
- Pain Point: [What's broken]
- Stage: [Where it happens]
- Potential Fix: [Idea]
- Impact: [High/Medium/Low]

OPPORTUNITY 2: [Name]
...
```

**Ask:**
> "Did I miss anything? What would you prioritize?"

---

### Phase 7: Wrap-Up & Next Steps (5 min)

**Facilitator summarizes:**

> "Here's what we created today:
> - Persona: [NAME]
> - Journey: [X] stages
> - Key pain points: [LIST]
> - Top opportunities: [LIST]
> 
> What's our next step? Validate with users? Prototype a fix? Dig deeper on one stage?"

---

### Post-Session Deliverables

1. **Journey Map Visual** — One-page view of stages, touchpoints, emotions
2. **Pain Point Backlog** — Prioritized list of issues
3. **Opportunity Cards** — Actionable improvement ideas
4. **Raw Notes** — Full transcript of session

---

### Tips for AI Facilitation

- **Keep momentum** — If silence, offer options: "Would you say it's more X or Y?"
- **Validate understanding** — Repeat back what you heard before moving on
- **Be flexible** — If a stage doesn't apply, skip it
- **Capture quotes** — When someone says something insightful, note it as a direct quote
- **Time-box** — Gently move on if one topic takes too long: "Let's capture that and move to the next stage"
