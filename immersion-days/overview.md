# AI Immersion Day — Overview

## Summary

**Series:** 10 AI Immersion Days (iterative delivery)  
**Dry Run Target:** Early March 2025  
**Philosophy:** Ship early, learn fast. First session maximizes pre-canned labs + logistics. Iterate after real-world learnings.

## Core Framework

Based on Roy's "5 Things" — the normal software development process applied to AI delivery.

See: [five-things.md](framework/five-things.md)

**Key Principles:**
- Proof of value over proof of concept
- Fewer buzzwords, more leverage
- Automation-first
- Operational reality over theoretical elegance
- Repeatable patterns, minimal artifacts

## Partner Set Pieces

| Partner | Asset | Description | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Nvidia** | Lab | Pre-built hands-on lab | ✅ Ready |
| **IBM** | Watson Orchestrate | TBD | 🔍 Research needed |
| **IBM** | Bob | CLI code assistant (Claude Code / Cline / Codex style) — potential vibe coding contest | 💡 Idea |
| **Cisco** | TBD | Awaiting their proposal | 🕐 1-2 weeks |
| **CrowdStrike** | TBD | Potential addition | ❓ TBD |

## Delivery Strategy

| Phase | Target | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 0: Dry Run** | Early March | Hand-picked internal technical folks, shake out issues |
| **Phase 1: Session 1** | TBD | Pre-canned labs (Nvidia), logistics, presentations. Expect turbulence. ~30 attendees. |
| **Phase 2+: Iterate** | Ongoing | Apply learnings from Phase 1, evolve content |

### Strategy Notes

> "The first one will suck. No matter what. Therefore, we maximize the pre-canned labs for the first one and focus on getting the logistics and presentations locked down. We will learn a lot trying to just get through a day of labs with 30 people in the room."
> 
> "After we crash and burn, we start iterating after we know where the hard things are."
