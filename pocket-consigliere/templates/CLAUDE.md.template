## Epic Sequence (Build Order)

**IMPORTANT:** Build in this order. Dependencies are critical.

| Epic | Priority | Why First | Blockers |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Epic 0: [Name] | **CRITICAL** | [Reason - e.g., "Go/no-go validation"] | None |
| Epic 1: [Name] | Must-have | [Reason - e.g., "Foundation for everything else"] | Epic 0 |
| Epic 2: [Name] | Must-have | [Reason] | Epic 1 |
| Epic 3: [Name] | Must-have | [Reason] | Epic 1, 2 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**After each Epic:**
- ✅ Run tests for that Epic
- ✅ Commit and push (checkpoint)
- ✅ Ask: "Epic [N] complete. Ready for Epic [N+1]?"

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Epic 0)
**Goal:** [What needs validation]  
**Timeline:** [Estimate]  
**Go/No-Go Decision:** [What happens if POC fails]

### Phase 2: Foundation (Epic 1)
**Goal:** [Core infrastructure]  
**Deliverables:** [Key files/modules]

### Phase 3-N: Feature Implementation
[Brief description of remaining epics]

## Critical Gotchas (Things That Will Break)

### 1. [Gotcha 1 Name]
**Problem:** [What will go wrong]  
**Mitigation:** [How to prevent/fix]  
**Where it matters:** [Which Epic]

### 2. [Gotcha 2 Name]
**Problem:** [What will go wrong]  
**Mitigation:** [How to prevent/fix]  
**Where it matters:** [Which Epic]

[Continue for all major gotchas identified in risk analysis]

---

## Test Strategy

**Test after each Epic:**
- Unit tests (module-level)
- Functional tests (feature-level)
- Integration tests (cross-module)

**Test at end (after all Epics):**
- Full test suite
- First run validation (`npm run dev` or equivalent)
- Manual QA (smoke test critical paths)

**Performance targets:**
- [Metric 1]: [Target value]
- [Metric 2]: [Target value]

**Test coverage goals:**
- [Coverage target, e.g., ">80% for business logic"]

## File Structure

**Key directories:**
```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── main/          # [Purpose]
│   ├── renderer/      # [Purpose]
│   └── shared/        # [Purpose]
├── tests/             # [Test organization]
├── docs/              # [Documentation]
└── [other dirs]
```

**Where to find things:**
- Requirements: `[path/to/requirements.md]`
- Architecture: `[path/to/ARCHITECTURE.md]`
- Implementation plan: `[path/to/implementation-plan.md]`
- Epics & stories: `[path/to/epics-stories.md]`

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Building
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone [repo-url]
cd [project-dir]

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn, pnpm, etc.

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env  # if applicable
```

### 2. Implement Epic
- Read Epic goals from implementation plan
- Implement tasks → subtasks
- Write tests alongside code
- Run tests for completed Epic

### 3. Checkpoint
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Epic [N]: [Epic Name] - [Brief summary]"
git push
```

### 4. Validation
After all Epics:
```bash
npm test           # Run full test suite
npm run dev        # First run validation
```

## Notes for AI Assistants

**Plan mode recommended:** This project has clear Epic sequencing. Use plan mode to respect dependencies.

**Commit frequency:** Commit after every Epic (not every subtask). This creates clear checkpoints.

**Test execution:** Write tests during Epic implementation, run full suite at end.

**First run validation:** After tests pass, suggest running the app (`npm run dev`). This catches config issues tests miss.

**Error handling:** If errors occur, diagnose and fix autonomously when possible. Escalate if uncertain about fix impact.
